MNIST Image Classification Pipeline This notebook demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for image classification using the MNIST dataset. It includes data loading and preprocessing, training and evaluation of both a traditional machine learning model (Logistic Regression) and a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a comparison of their performance, and a reflection on the ethical considerations of using such models. Dataset The MNIST dataset is a built-in dataset in TensorFlow and other machine learning libraries, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels. 60,000 images are used for training and 10,000 for testing. How to Run the Notebook Open the notebook in Google Colab: You can upload the .ipynb file to Google Colab or open it directly if it's hosted online. Run all cells: Go to the "Runtime" menu and select "Run all". This will execute each cell in sequence, performing the data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, comparison, and visualization steps. Examine the outputs: Review the output of each cell to see the results of the data preprocessing, model training, performance metrics, and visualizations. The final markdown cell provides a summary of the key findings and ethical considerations. Pipeline Steps The notebook follows these steps: Load and Preprocess Data: Loads the MNIST dataset, normalizes pixel values, and splits the data into training and test sets. Train and Evaluate Baseline Model: Flattens the images, trains a Logistic Regression model, and evaluates its performance. Build, Train, and Evaluate Deep Learning Model: Builds and trains a simple CNN model and evaluates its performance. Compare Models: Compares the performance of the Logistic Regression and CNN models. Address Ethics and Reflection: Discusses ethical considerations related to AI model mistakes, real-world risks, fairness, and reliability. CNN Training History Visualization: Plots the training and validation accuracy and loss of the CNN model.
